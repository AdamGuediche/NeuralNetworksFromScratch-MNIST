# NeuralNetworksFromScratch-MNIST

NumPy-based neural network built from scratch (following Sentdex’s *Neural Networks from Scratch* book), trained on the MNIST dataset with **97.5% accuracy**.

## Files Overview

* **`neuralNetworks.py`** — main classes and core neural network implementation
* **`Mnist_training.py`** — training code; generates a `mnist.model` file (already included in the repo)
* **`Mnist_test.py`** — testing script for evaluating the trained model
